# HospitalData
This project was created to solve a real world problem that was observed in hospitals, the case of missing or lost paper file medical record for patient and error in medication incase of emergency for patient which the medical professionals could not have access to their medical and treatment history. 																					
The goal of this project is not to create a website but it is about creating a database for that can be integrated into hospital website or application which can help to collate patients' record in a database and this can help to solve the problem of missing or lost file which is common to the paper file record method used in most hospitals. 

This can also help in providing fast access to patient record and improve efficeincy, simplifying administrative work, it can help to support compliance.


This can also help to have a continuous record of patients' medical history from birth to present/death.

The idea of this database system can help the medical professional to prevent error in their medication and to have history of medication used for a patient in time past and what the outcome of the treatment is and this result in reduction in mortality rate due to wrong medication and diagnosis

This database system also can help provide realworld clinical data that can be used for education, research and statistical tracking to access quality health care.

This system can also help to make realworld data available for health analyst to draw insight from data for instance the prevalent disease in a region and this can help to inform the kind of medication that works

It can also help in easy transfer of Electronic Health Record of patient from one hospital to another.

The database consist of 14 columns which include Patient_Name, Age, Gender, Contact, Region, Blood_Type, Medical_Condition, Date_Of_Admision, Insurance, Admission_type, Treatment, Treatment_Result, Discharge_Date, Doctor.

It include a simple login page which is "login.html" and patient form page, "patient.php' to create a demo of how a doctor can submit the patient record into the database when it is integrated into an hospital website or application.
